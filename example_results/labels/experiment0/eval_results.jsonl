Following Crops Following crops after normal harvest There are no restrictions on following crops after the normal harvest of winter wheat treated with Sovorna alone. Between application of Sovorna and the planting with any type of ryegrass or other forage grasses, observe a minimum interval of 12 months. Following application in spring barley, there are no restrictions if planting any type of cereal crop in the same autumn. For any other crop following application in spring barley, plough to at least 15cm before planting.
