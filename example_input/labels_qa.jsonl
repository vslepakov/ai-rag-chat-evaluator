{"question": "Where is Agardia allowed to be used?", "truth": "Agardia is allowed to be used only in England, Scotland, and Wales."}
{"question": "What does one capsule of Agardia contain?", "truth": "One capsule of Agardia contains 400 g/l cinmethylin and 38 g/l picolinafen."}
{"question": "What crops can be treated by both Agardia and Sovorna?", "truth": "Both Agardia and Sovorna can be used to treat winter wheat and spring barley."}
{"question": "What restrictions apply to Agardia usage?", "truth": "1. Agardia is suitable for use on all soil types except sands, very light soils, and very stony or gravelly soils. It should not be used on water-logged soil or soils prone to water logging. It should also not be used on soils with more than 10% organic matter. 2. Loose or cloddy seedbeds must be consolidated before application to avoid reduced weed control or crop damage. 3. Agardia should be applied from pre-emergence up to and including GS 13 of the crop. 4. The recommended rate of application for Agardia is 1.25 liters per hectare. 5. There are no restrictions on following crops after the normal harvest of winter wheat treated with Agardia alone. However, if planting any type of ryegrass or other forage grasses, a minimum interval of 12 months should be observed. For other crops following application in spring barley, ploughing to at least 15cm before planting is recommended. Please note that this information is specific to the Agardia product and may not apply to other products or formulations."}
{"question": "How many litres of Agardia should be used per hectare?", "truth": "The recommended rate of application for Agardia is 1.25 liters per hectare."}
{"question": "How many litres of Agardia should be used per hectare?", "truth": "The recommended rate of application for Agardia is 1.25 liters per hectare For Sovorna, the recommended rate of application is 2.0 liters per hectare Therefore, the dosage recommendation for Sovorna is higher than that for Agardia."}
{"question": "How do soil type restrictions vary between Agardia and Sovorna?", "truth": "Both Agardia and Sovorna have similar soil type restrictions. They are suitable for use on all soil types as defined by the Soil Texture (85) System, except for sands, very light soils, and very stony or gravelly soils due to the increased risk of crop damage. Additionally, both products should not be used on water-logged soils or soils prone to water logging, and they should not be used on soils with more than 10% organic matter."}
{"question": "Explain why it is important to not apply Agardia when heavy rain is forecast?", "truth": "It is important not to apply Agardia when heavy rain is forecast because heavy rain can lead to crop thinning or reductions in crop vigor, which may result in yield reductions. Very wet weather after application can cause a crop check, although this usually grows out after a few weeks and yields are normally unaffected. Additionally, heavy rain can exacerbate the risk of waterlogging, which is detrimental to the crop."}
